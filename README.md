# Personal project

To make the board, it has been used a canvas.

This is an Alfa version. I will try to upload it a refactor in some days and I will try to make small improvements when I will have time.

I didn't spend to much time on the design. It is one of the things that I will improve in a future version.

If you want to clone the repo to play around, improve the code or just to play, go ahead, I just ask you to mention the authorhsip :).

Enjoy and share. Marlon Velásquez

Thanks to Javier Muñiz for his excelent HTML5 and JavaScript course, without it perhaps it wouldn't be posible this tetris.

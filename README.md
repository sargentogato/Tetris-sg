## Intro

To make the board, it has been used a canvas.

This is an **Alfa** version. I will try to upload a refactor in some days and I will try to make small improvements when I will have time. I didn't spend to much time on the design. It is one of the things that I will improve in a future version.  
If you want to clone the repo to play around, improve the code or just to play, go ahead, I just ask you to mention the authorship :).

Enjoy and share. Marlon Velásquez

## How to Play

The only you have to do is, download the repo. Inside the folder you will find the follow structure

- script folder /tetris.js and pieces.js
- style folder / style.css
- index.html on the main folder

Don't worry for the rest of files.

The only you have to do is, download the repo, once downloaded, unzip the file. You will get a folder call Tetris-sg-master, get into and you will have the index.html file, run it, press start and enjoy.

**To move the pieces, you just need the arrow buttons**

- Left
- Right
- Down
- To rotate the piece press **Space bar**

## Upgrades

#### 22 de mayo 2020

- It has been added two buttons(**still not working**) start and play again

#### 2 July 2020

- The buttons work

## Changes

#### 22 may 2020

- Now the board array is done automatically with the new boardConstructor function.
- It has been renamed all to English.
- It has been done some refactor to:
  - The drawPieces method (switch statement instead of if statement)
  - the drawBoard function (switch statement instead of if statement)
- It has been separated the pieces variable to a new file call pieces.js

## Thanks

Thanks to Javier Muñiz(javiermunizyt on github) for his excelent HTML5 and JavaScript course, without it perhaps it wouldn't be posible this tetris.
